# Purpose:      Find a word based on user input if the word has all letters in alphabetical order.
# Input:        user input of a word.
# Process:      Convert the word to lowercase then check to make sure each letter falls below or equal to the previous letter.
# Output:       Print functions will tell the user if their word is or is not in alphabetical order.
# Honor Code:   On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.

    return all(word[i] <= word[i + 1] for i in range(len(word) - 1))
