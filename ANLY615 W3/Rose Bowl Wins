# Program:      PY HW 4, Problem 5
# Purpose:      Determine the teams from the given txt file that have more than 4 Rose Bowl wins.
# Input:        Import and read the original .txt file.
# Process:      Count the number of wins for each team and put them into a new dictionary. Write the results to a new CSV file, then limit results to teams with more than 4 Rose Bowl wins.
# Output:       Print the results to display which team names have more than 4 Rose Bowl wins and show the total number of wins by these teams.
# Honor Code:   On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.

# Import necessary functions needed.
