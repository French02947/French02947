# Program:      PY HW 5, Problem 2
# Purpose:      Find a random four digit number that, when multiplied by 4, is the reverse of the original number.
# Input:        Find a random number between the numbers 1000 and 9999 to include these two numbers.
# Process:      Generate a find number sequence then multiply these numbers by 4. After, check to ensure the number matches the original number in reverse.
# Output:       Generate results as finding the correct output of the original number and its reverse.
# Honor Code:   On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.

        # Utilize def statement to run that the numbers are reverse when multiplied by 4.
        if is_reverse(num, multiplied):
            return num
    return None
