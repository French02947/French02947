# Program:      PY HW 5, Problem 5
# Purpose:      Determine the states in order from least to most consonants in its name.
# Input:        Identify what the vowels are and read the States.txt file.
# Process:      Read the .txt file making sure all lines are read separately, count consonants of each state, then sort the states.
# Output:       In ascending order, show the results of the states with the least consonants to the most.
# Honor Code:   On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.

    # Define vowels

    # Count consonants by checking that each character is a letter AND not a vowel.
    return sum(1 for char in word if char.isalpha() and char not in vowels)

    # Read the file into a list

        states = [line.strip() for line in file]

    # Sort the list based on number of consonants
    states_sorted = sorted(states, key=count_consonants)

    # Print the sorted list
