# Program:      PY HW3, Problem 6
# Purpose:      Calculate Raise amounts for current employees based on current Salary amount.
# Input:        User Input of Salary, First Name, and Last Name.
# Process:      After all inputs are correctly registered, Salary will be used to calculate the new raise amount then added to a new total salary amount.
# Output:       Print the results of the Old Salary, Raise amount (not including old salary), Raise rate (in percentage), and the new total salary.
# Honor Code:   On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.
