# Program:      PY HW3, Problem 4
# Purpose:      Properly calculate the factorial of a given integer input.
# Input:        User Input of a given positive number.
# Process:      Identify a pattern to calculate the factorial of the input. Recover the integer first, then run factorial calculation.
# Output:       Print the result of the positive number followed by the answer to its factorial.
# Honor Code:   On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.
