# Author:       Rory French
# Course:       ANLY615
# Program:      PY HW2, Problem 2
# Purpose:      Test an end user to identify which railroad is not a part of the Monopoly Franchise.
# Input:        The data needed for the program to run is the list of Monopoly Railroads, to include 1 false Monopoly Railroad.
# Process:      Deliver a loop for the system to run given on specific answers to determine if the input given is correct or not. The loop will allow users more chances to guess correctly.
# Output:       Display a list of Monopoly Railroads to choose from at the beginning. After each guess, display whether the answer was correct or not.
# Honor Code:   On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.

#Define a list of all railroads in Monopoly to include one that is not correct:
monopoly_railroads = ["Reading Railroad", "Pennsylvania Railroad", "B&E Railroad", "Short Line Railroad"]
    
#Print the Railroads list
print("In Monopoly, the following properties are railroads:", monopoly_railroads)

#IF/Else for possible answers with the given solution printed
while True:
    try:
        answer = input("Which property is not the correct Monopoly Railroad?")
        
        if answer.lower() != "b&e railroad":
            print("I'm sorry. That is not correct. Try again")
            continue
        else:
            print("Correct! It is actually B&O Railroad!")
            break
    except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Try Again")
