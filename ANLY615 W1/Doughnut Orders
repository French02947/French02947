# Purpose:      Identify the cost of purchasing doughnuts by the amount ordered.
# Input:        The data needed is the price for less than a half dozen and a half dozen purchased or more.
# Process:      Calculate the amount per doughnut based on an input from the user than determines the actual cost per doughnut.
# Output:       Display the cost per doughnut and the total amount of the purchase based on user input.
# Honor Code:   On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.


# Print input asking how many doughnuts are to be purchased.
num_doughnuts = int(input("How many doughnuts are you ordering?"))

# Define the price of doughnuts based on how many are ordered:
def cost_per_doughnut(num_doughnuts):
    if num_doughnuts < 6:
        cost_per_doughnut = 1.00
    else:
        cost_per_doughnut = 0.75

    total_cost = cost_per_doughnut * num_doughnuts
    return total_cost

# Print output statement for cost of based on doughnuts ordered and cost per doughnut.
total_cost = cost_per_doughnut(num_doughnuts)
print(f"The total cost for {num_doughnuts} doughnut(s) is: ${total_cost}.")
